# 2-7. Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
# Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
# Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().
